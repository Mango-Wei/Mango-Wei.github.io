## Welcome 

Elise Wei is currently a Computer Science student at Dartmouth College, NH.
I have done some front-end and back-end small projects by myself. I enjoy working on algorithms.
My track at Dartmouth College is in digital arts, so I am also studying computer graphics extensively.

### Adventure Time

I lived in Shanghai for 8 years and also lived in Northern Europe for a while. Now I am settled in New Hampshire, near the White Mountain Forest Park.
Learning computers is very interesting for me, but also very hard.
