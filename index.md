## Welcome 

Elise Wei is currently a Computer Science student at Dartmouth College, NH.
I have done some front-end and back-end small projects by myself. I enjoy working on algorithms.
My track at Dartmouth College is in digital arts, so I am also studying computer graphics extensively.

OSCAR WILDE > LE JARDIN

The lily's withered chalice falls
Around its rod of dusty gold,
And from the beech-trees on the wold
The last wood-pigeon coos and calls.

The gaudy leonine sunflower
Hangs black and barren on its stalk,
And down the windy garden walk
The dead leaves scatter, - hour by hour.

Pale privet-petals white as milk
Are blown into a snowy mass:
The roses lie upon the grass
Like little shreds of crimson silk.

Learning computers is very interesting for me, but also challenging.
