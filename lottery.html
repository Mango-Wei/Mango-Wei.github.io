			<h2>NLP Twitter sentiment analysis of Covid-19 Vaccines changes over time, using Python / BERT</h2>
			<p> I have utilized my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of Twitter datasets. Specifically, I have focused on people's feelings towards different variants of Covid-19, including Beta and Gamma. Through the use of advanced techniques, including BERT, I have been able to accurately analyze sentiment, providing insights into how individuals are feeling about these variants.

<br>By leveraging NLP, I have been able to analyze large volumes of Twitter data, providing valuable insights into the public's feelings towards different Covid-19 variants. This analysis has required not only an understanding of Python programming but also a deep knowledge of the underlying algorithms and techniques used in NLP. I have been able to apply this knowledge to create an innovative approach to analyzing sentiment in Twitter datasets.

<br>Overall, my experience in Python programming and NLP has given me the ability to provide valuable insights into how individuals are feeling about different Covid-19 variants. Through the use of BERT and other advanced techniques, I have been able to accurately analyze sentiment, providing valuable insights into the public's perception of these variants. My expertise in this area has allowed me to contribute to the understanding of Covid-19 and its impact on society.</p>
